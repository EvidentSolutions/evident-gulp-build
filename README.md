evident-gulp-build
==================

Common builds for Angular apps using Browserify, Sass, etc.

Getting started
---------------

For now things are really not configurable at all and the project is not expected to be useful to you.
To use, execute `npm install --save-dev gulp evident-gulp-build` and create `gulpfile.js` with following
configuration:

    require('evident-gulp-build').register();
